| **Goal**                   | Connect to GCP Console
| **Task**                   | Open GCP Console in Incognito browser window
| **Verify task completion** | You should see the resources configured in the lab environment

## Open Console

When your lab is fully provisioned, you will seee a list of student resources on the left panel.  This screen should be left up for the duration of the lab.  If you close it by accident, you can re-open it by clicking on the lab session again See "CH1: Setup".   It is probably a good idea to copy and paste these values into your text editor for safe keeping.

- Right lick on **Open Console** and choose **Open Link in Incognito Window**

- Click **Next**
